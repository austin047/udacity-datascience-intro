## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are no additional libraries used here  beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project I used the  Stack Overflow data from 2017 to analyse and do observation to answer some questions on the data set, the 3 main questions to be answerd here are:

1. Does an individual need a higher degree to earn high in the tech industry.
2. What are the other forms of education fulltime and parttime workers in the tech industry take aswell apart from formal education.
3. What are some of the self-taught types individuals in the tech fields use for thier day to day questions and problems.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 main files in the project. One notebook 'project.ipynb' file containing source code for this project, visualization and README.md file.
 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of this source code can be found at the end of the main project.ipynb notebook file and  here [here](https://medium.com/@fuhaustin/can-you-earn-high-in-the-tech-field-without-a-higher-degree-aaee2837098c).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
